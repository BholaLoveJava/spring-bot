# Poll Bot

This provides a Poll bot, to demonstrate the [Chat Workflow](../../libs/chat-workflow/README.md) module.

## NB: Not currently working

This is being updated to use Symphony's new updating messages feature, so that the results of the poll are always updated.  However, there are bugs in the `updateMessage` functionality which are preventing us from having a working 9.0.0 Poll Bot.
